WHEN IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN EVENTS IT BECOMES NECESSARY FOR PEOPLE TO DISSOLVE THE POLITICAL QUALITY BANDS WHICH HAVE CONNECTED THEM WITH ANOTHER AND TO ASSUME AMONG THE POWERS OF THE EARTH, OUR MOST VALUABLE, THE SEPARATE AND THE EQUAL STATION TO WHICH THE LAWS OF NATURE AND OF NATURE'S GOD ENTITLE THEM, A DECENT RESPECT TO THE OPINIONS OF MAN KIND REQUIRES THAT THEY SHOULD DECLARE THE CAUSES WHICH IMPEL THEM TO THE XSEPARATION.
WE HOLD THERE YTRUTHS TO ME SELF-EVIDENT, ZTHAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, THAT THEY ARE ENDOWEDN BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS, THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PERSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THAT TO SECURE THERE RIGHTS, GOVERNMENTS ARE INSTITUTED AMONG MEN, DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED. THAT WHENEVER ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE OF THESE ENDS, IT IS THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO ALTER OR TO ABOLISH IT, AND INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT.
